Bug List

1. Enqueue
  I believe enqueue incorrectly adds a value to the front of the queue instead
  of the back. For example, adding the value of 1, then adding 2 to an empty Queue
  should mean the first value in the queue is 11 followed by 2 since a Queue is a FIFO
  structure. However, if you call peekFront after adding 1 and 2, it returns 2.


2. destructor
  The destructor does appear to delete the nodes, at least enough that the you cannot
  call additional Queue functions after deleting the queue. However, the queue ptr is
  not getting set back to nullptr after deletion. There is still memory allocated For
  the Queue even if there is no actual tangile queue left to interact with.
