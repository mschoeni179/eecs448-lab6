Bug List

1. Enqueue
  I believe enqueue incorrectly adds a value to the front of the queue instead
  of the back. For example, adding the value of 0, then adding 1 to an empty Queue
  should mean the first value in the queue is 0 followed by 1 since a Queue is a FIFO
  structure. However, if you call peekFront it returns 1.


2. destructor
  The destructor is semi successful, at least enough that the you cannot
  call additional Queue functions after deleting a queue. However, the ptr is
  not getting set back to nullptr after deletion. After calling the destructor on a heap
  Queue, the ptr != null. There is still memory allocated for the Queue even if
  there is no actual tangible queue left to interact with. When running valgrind it shows
  erors coming from enqueue. The allocs don't match the frees.
